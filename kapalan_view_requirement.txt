Hey Kenny,

We actually had a coding exercise for you.  You can use React if you like as we are just trying to see how you attack this challenge:

The attached mockup shows a potential design for an upcoming feature on our platform.


Use Node.js to build a web application that lists channel sessions according to this design. Use the provided sample data channel.json. You may use any JavaScript or CSS libraries or frameworks to complete this exercise.


We will be looking for appropriate semantic HTML5 markup, a strong grasp of CSS, an understanding of JavaScript and properly separated concerns. 


Can you please provide link to the repo where your completed work is for this exercise. As a bonus, we hope you can try to make the design responsive (you can provide your own styling for responsive viewports - we just want to see how you approach responsiveness).

I have attached the required design and data files below.

Thanks,
Andrew
